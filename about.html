        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p>I'm Angel Pilor, a front-end developer based in Calgary, AB, Canada. I recently graduated from the Web and Mobile Development Program 
            at Vancouver Island University, where my coding journey began during my Tumblr days. Back then, I fell head over heels for customizing 
            themes using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

            Last year, I had the amazing oppurtunity to work as a junior web developer during a summer internship at <a href="https://getalpha.ca/">Alpha.</a>
            I've also done various personal projects, including designing and building this very portfolio site, and crafting a Japanese quiz learning website called 
            <a href="https://itas-kuizu.vercel.app/">Kuizu</a> for my capstone project in my final year. 

            When I'm not coding, I love playing video games, building Lego sets, drinking matcha lattes, and taking lots of naps. Right now, I'm on the lookout for job oppurtunities, but
            I'm also open to doing some freelance work to let my creativity run wild! 

            Feel free to drop me a line to say hello or ask any questions. I'm always up for a chat or a new project! Let's connect and create something awesome together. 
        </p>
